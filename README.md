# Fit

This repository contains a minimal React-based fitness planner written in TypeScript. Open `index.html` in your browser to try it out. The app lets you:

- Enter personal settings (weight, height, goal).
- Add exercises with sets, reps, weight and assign them to specific days.
- Browse workouts in a monthly calendar view and navigate between months.

It uses React, Babel and the TypeScript preset from public CDNs, so there's no build step or dependencies. You can enhance it further by adding persistence or additional features.
